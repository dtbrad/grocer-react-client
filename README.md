# GROCER-REACT-CLIENT

A "working draft" of this app can be found at https://grocer-react-client.herokuapp.com

Grocer-React-Client is a start at translating my full stack Rails application, www.my-grocer.com (repo: https://github.com/dtbrad/grocer) into a separate Rails API and React web application. It currently has some basic JWT authentication, and index/show views for a user's shopping trips.

Its API is hosted at https://mygrocerapi.herokuapp.com and currently serves /baskets and basket/:id. For more information visit the API's repo at https://github.com/dtbrad/my_grocer_api.
